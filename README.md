# 🔥 DSA Practice Vault – A2Z 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repo** – a dedicated space where I solve problems, break down concepts, and sharpen my algorithmic thinking ✨.

🧠 **Why this repo?**  
To track my journey of mastering DSA through consistent problem-solving – one commit at a time. I’m following structured roadmaps like [Take U Forward's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/) and adding my own insights along the way.

## ✨ My Goals

- ✅ Build a strong foundation in problem-solving  
- ✅ Get comfortable with time & space complexity analysis  
- ✅ Prepare for coding interviews (Big Tech ready 💼)  
- 🔁 Consistently solve 3–5 problems per day  
- 🧩 Understand patterns behind problems, not just solutions

## 💻 How to Run

This repo uses plain Python (.py files). No fancy setup required.
